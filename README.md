3. **Balloons Stay in Place**:
   - Balloons freeze in position when tapped, providing clear visual feedback for selected inputs.

4. **Balloon Spacing**:
   - Balloons are evenly spaced horizontally to avoid clustering.

## **How to Play**
1. Start the game and watch balloons with numbers and operators float upward.
2. Tap on a **number balloon** first, followed by an **operator balloon** and another **number balloon** to form a valid math equation.
3. The result of your equation will be displayed at the top-left corner (`e.g., 6 + 4 = 10`).
4. Solve as many problems as you can before the timer runs out!
5. If you don't interact with the balloons for 1 minute, the game ends.
